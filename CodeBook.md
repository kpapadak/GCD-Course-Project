Variables starting with "f" are their "t" counterparts with a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applied to the signal.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
